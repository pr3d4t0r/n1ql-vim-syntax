N1QL						*n1ql.vim* *ft-n1ql-syntax*

N1QL is a SQL-like declarative language for manipulating JSON documents in
Couchbase Server databases.

Vim syntax highlights N1QL statements, keywords, operators, types, comments,
and special values.  Vim ignores syntactical elements specific to SQL or its
many dialects, like COLUMN or CHAR, that don't exist in N1QL.
